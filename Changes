    - The internal author-object constructor no longer chokes if it
    encounters author metadata that doesn't define every possible
    property.

    - Constructor throws an exception if the source and target URLs are
    too similar. (Thanks to Christian Weiske for the heads-up.)

    - The cpanfile better reflects prerequisites. (Thanks to Mohammad S
    Anwar for the patch.)

    - Documentation updates.
